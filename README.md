This is a web appilication coded in python using FLASK framework. It will consist of many mini useful tools that i coded myself either for personal use or work use. 

Tools I've made:
1. Encryption tool
   This tool is an text encryptor/decryptor using the Fernet algorithm. I included a password for an added layer of protection. 
2. IP subnet checker
   This tool is used to check whether two ip addresses are in the same subnet
